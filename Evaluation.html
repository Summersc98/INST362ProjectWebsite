                    Project by John Lloyde Rayela, Victoria Nathaniel, Zehra Patwary, and Chris Summers

            <h1>Process for Choosing</h1>
            <p>Our process of choosing included students in different classes, for example user-design class in time management group and cooking group. Our third user was a computer science student. We choose students because they are our main users. The decision to interview users from user design class was to get a better understanding of our design functionality since those students will also be able to understand design concepts. Also, it was somewhat convenient to interview students for us because we are also students and we interact with them day-to-day. Since our classes are online or hybrid, we were not able to interview any professors. </p>
            <h1>Data Collection Procedures</h1>
            <p>We collected data from our users through google forms and interviews. The interview was a walk through process for users to understand our design. After the interview, we decided to send out a survey form for users to fill out. The questions asked in the survey were short answer and multiple choice questions like state the pros and cons in the student and teacher view, and does the app seem easy to navigate. We chose these questions to see the current stage of our app, if it is effective and productive.</p>
            <h1>List of Findings</h1>
            <p>The data we obtained during the evaluation process was that questions in the student view should be multiple choice so that students can instantly view their grades after submission.  Another data we collected was that the tabs in the app should have a minimize button that hides out unused features to create more space on the screen. We observed that most of the users we interviewed had more pros than cons. They found our application more useful and effective because students can simultaneously view the lecture slides with the professor while the app is in lockdown mode and students can also choose to either take notes via the app or with pen and paper.</p>
            <h1>Future Design Steps</h1>
            <p>If we were to redesign our design, we would have a more detailed prototype. We would have designed another version, the mobile version which would be compatible on a phone since many students use their phones for online classes. Also, if a student is on-the-go they don’t have to miss lectures. In the mobile app, the student has the option to take voice recorded notes, which get saved to the files on the phone automatically so they are accessible. Overall, having a mobile version means that it is targeting more users. For example, many students cannot afford laptops, which means a potential bias is removed. </p>

            <h1>User Interaction Walkthrough</h1>
            <p>A student user would start using this prototype when they sit down to class.  After they join the class session, they would watch the professor give lecture for a while until the first integrated question pops up, at which point the student would try to answer the question.  Afterwords, the student may click the “Raise Hand” button if they become confused about the lesson, at which point the professor would unmute call on them to ask their question.  Near the end of class, the professor may enable lockdown mode for one final question before dismissing class and disconnecting everyone from the session.</p>
